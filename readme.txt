Adds an "Email Template" CPT for outputting HTML email templates for use in your preferred email sending service.

== Description ==

This plugin bridges the gap between content creators and HTML email designers. Content creators who wish to frequently send high-quality emails have always been at a disadvantage when it comes to crafting pixel-perfect HTML emails. This plugin allows creators and designers to work together by providing an Email Template CPT where creators can select posts to appear inside a template designed by an HTML email expert.
